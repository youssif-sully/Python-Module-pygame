# Python-Module-pygame

## The game divided into different modules for ease of use and debugging

### 1. [Colors Module](colors.py)

        defining some colors to use in the game (we can add more colors here)

### 2. [Config Module](config.py)

        defining screen width and height and also the FPS

### 3. [Initialize Module](init.py)

        initializing the pygame module, pygame mixer (used for sounds), 
        the screen (width and height imported from config module), screen label 
        and the clock (used to control the time of the game flow) [Game flow](flow.md)
